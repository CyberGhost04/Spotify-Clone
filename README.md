# Spotify App Player Clone

I'm excited to introduce my latest project - a **Spotify App Player Clone**. This application is built with modern web technologies and provides a seamless and user-friendly experience, similar to the real Spotify app.

## Features

- Play, Pause, and Next Song Navigation
- Local Storage of Songs
- Responsive Design for Different Screen Devices
- Hamburger Menu for Enhanced Mobile Experience

## User Requirement

To use this application, you need to download your own songs and place them in the artist folder within the songs directory in the project.
